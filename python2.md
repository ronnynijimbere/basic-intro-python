Python-Numbers
Everything in Python is an object and every object has an attributes and functions (methods)
there are 2 types of numbers in python
intergers and floats
intergers are whole numbers(1,3,4 etc)
floats- any numbers with decimal points( 1.6 , 2.5 etc)
python returns floats when we perform any type of divisions

=====================================================================
Strings
are sequence of characters(a sentence or a word)
=========================================
Lists
# #hello
# name = input('whoa is your daddy: ')
# age = input('...and your age: ')
# print(name, 'you are', age)

# Calculate the area of a circle
radius = input('Enter the radius of your circle(m): ')
area = 3.142 *int(radius)**2
print('The area of your circle is:', area)
====================================================
basic string formatting

ranges: creates a list of numbers which you can use to iterate
over with for loop

functions: allow us to create a block of code which can be called
up again to be used whenever we need it
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called,
You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function,
A function can return data as a result

variable scope: defines an area where a variable can be accessed in

dictionaries: is a mapping type, A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.

classes: a class is a blueprint of how an object should look and behave
and then we can create a new object that is based on that particular object
A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

list comprehensions: gives us alternative way to construct lists & dictionaries based on other collections

lambdas: similar to anonimous functions and this mean they dont need an identify..a function that you will ever use once

decorators: extend the behaviour of a function without modifying the function itself..its basically a wrapper function
